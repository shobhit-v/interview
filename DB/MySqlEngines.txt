MySQL provides various storage engines for its tables as below:

-MyISAM
-InnoDB
-MERGE
-MEMORY (HEAP)
-ARCHIVE
-CSV
-FEDERATED

Each storage engine has its own advantages and disadvantages.
It is crucial to understand each storage engine features and choose the most appropriate one for your tables to maximize the performance of the database.


=====MyISAM=====
-The MyISAM tables are optimized for compression and speed.

-MyISAM tables are also portable between platforms and operating systems.

-The size of MyISAM table can be up to 256TB

-MyISAM tables can be compressed into read-only tables to save spaces.

-At startup, MySQL checks MyISAM tables for corruption and even repairs them in a case of errors.

-The MyISAM tables are not transaction-safe.

-Before MySQL version 5.5, MyISAM is the default storage engine when you create a table without specifying the storage engine explicitly.

-From version 5.5, MySQL uses InnoDB as the default storage 


=====InnoDB=====
-The InnoDB tables fully support ACID-compliant and transactions

-ACID-compliant ( atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability): https://www.clustrix.com/bettersql/acid-compliance-means-care/

-They are also optimal for performance. 

-InnoDB table supports foreign keys, commit, rollback, roll-forward operations.

-The size of an InnoDB table can be up to 64TB.

-Like MyISAM, the InnoDB tables are portable between different platforms and operating systems. 

-Like MyISAM, At startup, MySQL checks also checks and repairs InnoDB tables.


=====MERGE=====
-A MERGE table is a virtual table that combines multiple MyISAM tables that have a similar structure into one table.

-The MERGE storage engine is also known as the MRG_MyISAM engine.

-The MERGE table does not have its own indexes; it uses indexes of the component tables instead.

-Using MERGE table, you can speed up performance when joining multiple tables. 

-MySQL only allows you to perform SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE and INSERT operations on the MERGE tables. 

-If you use DROP TABLE statement on a MERGE table, only MERGE specification is removed. he underlying tables will not be affected.


=====Memory=====
-The memory tables are stored in memory and use hash indexes so that they are faster than MyISAM tables.

-The lifetime of the data of the memory tables depends on the uptime of the database server. 

-The memory storage engine is formerly known as HEAP.

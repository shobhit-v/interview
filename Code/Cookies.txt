-A cookie is often used to identify a user.

-A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer. 

-Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too.

-With PHP, you can both create and retrieve cookie values.

-Create Cookies With PHP
setcookie(name, value, expire, path, domain, secure, httponly);

-Only the name parameter is required. All other parameters are optional.

-We then retrieve the value of the cookie  using the global variable $_COOKIE.

-We also use the isset() function to find out if the cookie is set

Note: The setcookie() function must appear BEFORE the <html> tag.

Note: The value of the cookie is automatically URLencoded when sending the cookie, and automatically decoded when received (to prevent URLencoding, use setrawcookie() instead).

-A cookie is often used to identify a user by storing user information in web pages.

-A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer. 

-When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page is added to the request. This way the server gets the necessary data to "remember" information about users.

-With PHP, you can both create and retrieve cookie values.

-Create Cookies With PHP
setcookie(name, value, expire, path, domain, secure, httponly);

-Only the name parameter is required. All other parameters are optional.

-We then retrieve the value of the cookie  using the global variable $_COOKIE.

-We also use the isset() function to find out if the cookie is set

-When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.
Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":
	-When a user visits a web page, his name can be stored in a cookie.
	-Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his name.

-Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like:

Note: The setcookie() function must appear BEFORE the <html> tag.

Note: The value of the cookie is automatically URLencoded when sending the cookie, and automatically decoded when received (to prevent URLencoding, use setrawcookie() instead).
